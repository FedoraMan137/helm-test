## TL;DR

```console
helm install my-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/postgresql
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

For HA, please see [this repo](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql-ha)

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/postgresql
```

The command deploys PostgreSQL on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components but PVC's associated with the chart and deletes the release.

To delete the PVC's associated with `my-release`:

```console
kubectl delete pvc -l release=my-release
```

> **Note**: Deleting the PVC's will delete postgresql data as well. Please be cautious before doing it.

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Customizing primary and read replica services in a replicated configuration

At the top level, there is a service object which defines the services for both primary and readReplicas. For deeper customization, there are service objects for both the primary and read types individually. This allows you to override the values in the top level service object so that the primary and read can be of different service types and with different clusterIPs / nodePorts. Also in the case you want the primary and read to be of type nodePort, you will need to set the nodePorts to different values to prevent a collision. The values that are deeper in the primary.service or readReplicas.service objects will take precedence over the top level service object.

### Use a different PostgreSQL version

To modify the application version used in this chart, specify a different version of the image using the `image.tag` parameter and/or a different repository using the `image.repository` parameter. Refer to the [chart documentation for more information on these parameters and how to use them with images from a private registry](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/infrastructure/postgresql/configuration/change-image-version/).

### postgresql.conf / pg_hba.conf files as configMap

This helm chart also supports to customize the PostgreSQL configuration file. You can add additional PostgreSQL configuration parameters using the `primary.extendedConfiguration`/`readReplicas.extendedConfiguration` parameters as a string. Alternatively, to replace the entire default configuration use `primary.configuration`.

You can also add a custom pg_hba.conf using the `primary.pgHbaConfiguration` parameter.

In addition to these options, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the configuration files. This is done by setting the `primary.existingConfigmap` parameter. Note that this will override the two previous options.

### Initialize a fresh instance

The [Bitnami PostgreSQL](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) image allows you to use your custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance. In order to execute the scripts, you can specify custom scripts using the `primary.initdb.scripts` parameter as a string.

In addition, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the initialization scripts. This is done by setting the `primary.initdb.scriptsConfigMap` parameter. Note that this will override the two previous options. If your initialization scripts contain sensitive information such as credentials or passwords, you can use the `primary.initdb.scriptsSecret` parameter.

The allowed extensions are `.sh`, `.sql` and `.sql.gz`.

### Securing traffic using TLS

TLS support can be enabled in the chart by specifying the `tls.` parameters while creating a release. The following parameters should be configured to properly enable the TLS support in the chart:

- `tls.enabled`: Enable TLS support. Defaults to `false`
- `tls.certificatesSecret`: Name of an existing secret that contains the certificates. No defaults.
- `tls.certFilename`: Certificate filename. No defaults.
- `tls.certKeyFilename`: Certificate key filename. No defaults.

For example:

- First, create the secret with the cetificates files:

    ```console
    kubectl create secret generic certificates-tls-secret --from-file=./cert.crt --from-file=./cert.key --from-file=./ca.crt
    ```

- Then, use the following parameters:

    ```console
    volumePermissions.enabled=true
    tls.enabled=true
    tls.certificatesSecret="certificates-tls-secret"
    tls.certFilename="cert.crt"
    tls.certKeyFilename="cert.key"
    ```

  > Note TLS and VolumePermissions: PostgreSQL requires certain permissions on sensitive files (such as certificate keys) to start up. Due to an on-going [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57923) regarding kubernetes permissions and the use of `containerSecurityContext.runAsUser`, you must enable `volumePermissions` to ensure everything works as expected.

### Sidecars

If you need  additional containers to run within the same pod as PostgreSQL (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the `sidecars` config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```yaml
# For the PostgreSQL primary
primary:
  sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - name: portname
     containerPort: 1234
# For the PostgreSQL replicas
readReplicas:
  sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
    - name: portname
     containerPort: 1234
```

### Metrics

The chart optionally can start a metrics exporter for [prometheus](https://prometheus.io). The metrics endpoint (port 9187) is not exposed and it is expected that the metrics are collected from inside the k8s cluster using something similar as the described in the [example Prometheus scrape configuration](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml).

The exporter allows to create custom metrics from additional SQL queries. See the Chart's `values.yaml` for an example and consult the [exporters documentation](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter#adding-new-metrics-via-a-config-file) for more details.

### Use of global variables

In more complex scenarios, we may have the following tree of dependencies

```text
                     +--------------+
                     |              |
        +------------+   Chart 1    +-----------+
        |            |              |           |
        |            --------+------+           |
        |                    |                  |
        |                    |                  |
        |                    |                  |
        |                    |                  |
        v                    v                  v
+-------+------+    +--------+------+  +--------+------+
|              |    |               |  |               |
|  PostgreSQL  |    |  Sub-chart 1  |  |  Sub-chart 2  |
|              |    |               |  |               |
+--------------+    +---------------+  +---------------+
```

The three charts below depend on the parent chart Chart 1. However, subcharts 1 and 2 may need to connect to PostgreSQL as well. In order to do so, subcharts 1 and 2 need to know the PostgreSQL credentials, so one option for deploying could be deploy Chart 1 with the following parameters:

```text
postgresql.auth.username=testuser
subchart1.postgresql.auth.username=testuser
subchart2.postgresql.auth.username=testuser
postgresql.auth.password=testpass
subchart1.postgresql.auth.password=testpass
subchart2.postgresql.auth.password=testpass
postgresql.auth.database=testdb
subchart1.postgresql.auth.database=testdb
subchart2.postgresql.auth.database=testdb
```

If the number of dependent sub-charts increases, installing the chart with parameters can become increasingly difficult. An alternative would be to set the credentials using global variables as follows:

```text
global.postgresql.auth.username=testuser
global.postgresql.auth.password=testpass
global.postgresql.auth.database=testdb
```

This way, the credentials will be available in all of the subcharts.

## Persistence

The [Bitnami PostgreSQL](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) image stores the PostgreSQL data and configurations at the `/bitnami/postgresql` path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

If you already have data in it, you will fail to sync to standby nodes for all commits, details can refer to the [code present in the container repository](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql). If you need to use those data, please covert them to sql and import after `helm install` finished.

## NetworkPolicy

To enable network policy for PostgreSQL, install [a networking plugin that implements the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy#before-you-begin), and set `networkPolicy.enabled` to `true`.

For Kubernetes v1.5 & v1.6, you must also turn on NetworkPolicy by setting the DefaultDeny namespace annotation. Note: this will enforce policy for _all_ pods in the namespace:

```console
kubectl annotate namespace default "net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={\"ingress\":{\"isolation\":\"DefaultDeny\"}}"
```

With NetworkPolicy enabled, traffic will be limited to just port 5432.

For more precise policy, set `networkPolicy.allowExternal=false`. This will only allow pods with the generated client label to connect to PostgreSQL.
This label will be displayed in the output of a successful install.

## Differences between Bitnami PostgreSQL image and [Docker Official](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image

- The Docker Official PostgreSQL image does not support replication. If you pass any replication environment variable, this would be ignored. The only environment variables supported by the Docker Official image are POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS, POSTGRES_INITDB_WALDIR and PGDATA. All the remaining environment variables are specific to the Bitnami PostgreSQL image.
- The Bitnami PostgreSQL image is non-root by default. This requires that you run the pod with `securityContext` and updates the permissions of the volume with an `initContainer`. A key benefit of this configuration is that the pod follows security best practices and is prepared to run on Kubernetes distributions with hard security constraints like OpenShift.
- For OpenShift up to 4.10, let set the volume permissions, security context, runAsUser and fsGroup automatically by OpenShift and disable the predefined settings of the helm chart: primary.securityContext.enabled=false,primary.containerSecurityContext.enabled=false,volumePermissions.enabled=false,shmVolume.enabled=false
- For OpenShift 4.11 and higher, let set OpenShift the runAsUser and fsGroup automatically. Configure the pod and container security context to restrictive defaults and disable the volume permissions setup: primary.
    podSecurityContext.fsGroup=null,primary.podSecurityContext.seccompProfile.type=RuntimeDefault,primary.containerSecurityContext.runAsUser=null,primary.containerSecurityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false,primary.containerSecurityContext.runAsNonRoot=true,primary.containerSecurityContext.seccompProfile.type=RuntimeDefault,primary.containerSecurityContext.capabilities.drop=['ALL'],volumePermissions.enabled=false,shmVolume.enabled=false

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `XXX.affinity` parameter(s). Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `XXX.podAffinityPreset`, `XXX.podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `XXX.nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.
